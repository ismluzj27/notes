# System Development Lifecycle

TODO: transfer to paper

### Learning Objectives

- Discuss the stages in system development life cycle
- Take a detailed look into the key points in each stage
- Explain the terms end-user and stakeholder
- Distinguish between the end-user and the stakeholder in a given scenario

## Stages (cycle)

1. [Planning](#planning)
2. [Analysis](#analysis)
3. [Design](#design) 
4. [Development](#development)
5. [Testing/Debugging](#testing)
6. [Implementation](#implementation)
7. [Maintenance/Evaluation](#maintenance)

- Development and implementation can be switched

## Planning

*Identify system goals.* Primary objectives and outcomes that the system should
achieve. What is the program trying to do?

*Define project scope.* Boundaries, deliverables, and constraints-- features,
functionalities, and target users.

*Set objectives.* SMART: Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time
bound. Aligns with system goals and project scope.

*Establish timeline.* How long will it take? Milestones, checkpoints, phases,
deadlines, and some leniency in timing. 

*Determine available resources.* Identify and allocate necessary resources.
Human resources, budget, technology, materials for project implementation.

*Importance.* Ensure alignment with organizational needs, sets clear direction.

## Analysis

*Understand system requirements.* Through interviews, process study, analyze
existing system processes.

*Identify stakeholders' needs,* preferences, and challenges. Ensure project
meets expectations. [SDLC Example](img/sdlc_example.png)

## Design

*User-centric design.* Meets their needs and preferences.

*Usability.* Intuitive, easy to use. Accessible _(usable by as many people as
possible, even with disabilities)_ and ergonomic.

*Feedback Integration.* Involving end users in the planning process. Open to
suggestions.

*Adoption and acceptance* by end-user due to good design: *Long term success*.

## Development

*Objective: write code* and create the system.

*Code implementation* based on design specifications. Coding standards, best
practices, security protocols.

*Create database structures:* implement any databases or file types that are
being used. Create tables, relationships, and queries to support data storage
and retrieval.

*Implement necessary functionalities.* Develop and integrate system functions
like user authentication, data processing, reporting.

## Testing

*Rigorous testing* procedures like debugging tools from an IDE, trace tables

*Testing behavior* and expected, unexpected outputs, error handling, edge
cases, etc.

## Implementation

*Objective: deploy the system* into production environment. Minimize
disruptions.

*System installation* and configuration of components. Software, hardware, and
network infrastructure in the production environment.

*Data migration* into new systems, ensuring data integrity.

*End-user training* and support to ensure effective use.

*Infrastructure configuration* and optimization like servers, databases, and
security settings for optimal system performance and reliability.

## Maintenance

*Evaluate what can be improved.* Feedback from peers and users

*Include contact info* for end-users to give their suggestions/feedback.

*Set up system* for users to make suggestions, bug reports, raise issues, etc.
