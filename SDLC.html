<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>
<p><em>Identify system goals.</em> Primary objectives and outcomes that
the system should achieve. What is the program trying to do?</p>
<p><em>Define project scope.</em> Boundaries, deliverables, and
constraints– features, functionalities, and target users.</p>
<p><em>Set objectives.</em> SMART: Specific, measurable, achievable,
relevant, time bound. Aligns with system goals and project scope.</p>
<p><em>Establish timeline.</em> How long will it take? Milestones,
checkpoints, phases, deadlines, and some leniency in timing.</p>
<p><em>Determine available resources.</em> Identify and allocate
necessary resources. Human resources, budget, technology, materials for
project implementation.</p>
<p><em>Importance.</em> Ensure alignment with organizational needs, sets
clear direction.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p><em>Understand system requirements.</em> Through interviews, process
study, analyze existing system processes.</p>
<p><em>Identify stakeholders’ needs,</em> preferences, and challenges.
Ensure project meets expectations. <a href="img/sdlc_example.png">SDLC
Example</a></p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p><em>User-centric design.</em> Meets their needs and preferences.</p>
<p><em>Usability.</em> Intuitive, easy to use. Accessible <em>(usable by
as many people as possible, even with disabilities)</em> and
ergonomic.</p>
<p><em>Feedback Integration.</em> Involving end users in the planning
process. Open to suggestions.</p>
<p><em>Adoption and acceptance</em> by end-user due to good design:
<em>Long term success</em>.</p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p><em>Objective: write code</em> and create the system.</p>
<p><em>Code implementation</em> based on design specifications. Coding
standards, best practices, security protocols.</p>
<p><em>Create database structures:</em> implement any databases or file
types that are being used. Create tables, relationships, and queries to
support data storage and retrieval.</p>
<p><em>Implement necessary functionalities.</em> Develop and integrate
system functions like user authentication, data processing,
reporting.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p><em>Rigorous testing</em> procedures like debugging tools from an
IDE, trace tables</p>
<p><em>Testing behavior</em> and expected, unexpected outputs, error
handling, edge cases, etc.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p><em>Objective: deploy the system</em> into production environment.
Minimize disruptions.</p>
<p><em>System installation</em> and configuration of components.
Software, hardware, and network infrastructure in the production
environment.</p>
<p><em>Data migration</em> into new systems, ensuring data
integrity.</p>
<p><em>End-user training</em> and support to ensure effective use.</p>
<p><em>Infrastructure configuration</em> and optimization like servers,
databases, and security settings for optimal system performance and
reliability.</p>
<h2 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h2>
<p><em>Evaluate what can be improved.</em> Feedback from peers and
users</p>
<p><em>Include contact info</em> for end-users to give their
suggestions/feedback.</p>
<p><em>Set up system</em> for users to make suggestions, bug reports,
raise issues, etc.</p>
