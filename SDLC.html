<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>
<p><em>Identify system goals.</em> Primary objectives and outcomes that
the system should achieve. What is the program trying to do?</p>
<p><em>Define project scope.</em> Boundaries, deliverables, and
constraints– features, functionalities, and target users.</p>
<p><em>Set objectives.</em> SMART: Specific, measurable, achievable,
relevant, time bound. Aligns with system goals and project scope.</p>
<p><em>Establish timeline.</em> How long will it take? Milestones,
checkpoints, phases, deadlines, and some leniency in timing.</p>
<p><em>Determine available resources.</em> Identify and allocate
necessary resources. Human resources, budget, technology, materials for
project implementation.</p>
<p><em>Importance.</em> Ensure alignment with organizational needs, sets
clear direction.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p><em>Understand system requirements.</em> Through interviews, process
study, analyze existing system processes.</p>
<p><em>Identify stakeholders’ needs,</em> preferences, and challenges.
Ensure project meets expectations. <img src="img/sdlc_example.png"

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p><em>User-centric design.</em> Meets their needs and preferences.</p>
<p><em>Usability.</em> Intuitive, easy to use. Accessible <em>(usable by
as many people as possible, even with disabilities)</em> and
ergonomic.</p>
<p><em>Feedback Integration.</em> Involving end users in the planning
process. Open to suggestions.</p>
<p><em>Adoption and acceptance</em> by end-user due to good design:
<em>Long term success</em>.</p>
