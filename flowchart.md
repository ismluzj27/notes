# Flowchart

Diagram that illustrates the *sequence of operations* to be performed to get to
the solution of a problem. *One input, one output.* 

Start with a *trigger event*. Direction is importantâ€”top to bottom, left to
right. The flowchart has a logical *start and finish*.

## Shapes

| Description			| Shape |
| --- | --- |
| *Start and end*		| rounded rectangle / ellipse |
| *Process*				| rectangle |
| *Input and output*	| parallelogram |
| *Condition*			| diamond (also called *selection* or *decision*) |
| *Data store*          | cylinder |

All have only *one arrow out* except for the diamond, which has *two* and only
two outputs (yes or no).

Diamond statements always asked as a yes or no question.

To show accessing to a data store, draw an arrow from the cylinder to a
parallelogram. [Image 0002](img/img25apr0002.jpg)
